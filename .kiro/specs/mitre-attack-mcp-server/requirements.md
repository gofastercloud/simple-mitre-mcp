## Introduction

This feature involves building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Large Language Models to explore and query the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The MCP server will provide structured access to this information, allowing LLMs to help users understand cybersecurity threats, analyze attack patterns, and explore defensive strategies.

The server provides both **basic analysis tools** for fundamental ATT&CK queries and **advanced threat modeling capabilities** for sophisticated security analysis workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs a global search THEN the system SHALL search across tactics, techniques, and mitigations
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL indicate the entity type (tactic, technique, mitigation) for each result
3. WHEN a user requests detailed information about a search result THEN the system SHALL provide the full entity details

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a threat hunter, I want to query tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for specific threat groups so that I can understand their attack patterns and prepare defenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests information about a specific threat group THEN the system SHALL return the group's profile including aliases and description
2. WHEN a user requests TTPs for a specific group THEN the system SHALL return all tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with that group
3. WHEN a user searches for groups by keyword THEN the system SHALL return matching groups based on name, aliases, or description content
4. WHEN a user requests groups that use a specific technique THEN the system SHALL return all threat groups known to use that technique

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the MCP server, I want proper error handling and data validation so that the system is reliable and robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid input is provided THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with guidance
2. WHEN the MITRE ATT&CK data source is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
4. WHEN the system starts up THEN it SHALL validate that required data sources are accessible
5. WHEN the MCP server is implemented THEN it SHALL use the official MCP library to ensure standards compliance

## Advanced Threat Modeling Requirements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security architect, I want to construct multi-stage attack paths through the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain so that I can understand how adversaries progress through tactics to achieve their objectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies start and end tactics THEN the system SHALL construct a logical attack path showing technique progression
2. WHEN a user filters by threat group THEN the system SHALL build attack paths using only techniques known to be used by that group
3. WHEN a user filters by platform THEN the system SHALL include only techniques applicable to the specified platform
4. WHEN an attack path is incomplete THEN the system SHALL indicate gaps and suggest alternative paths
5. WHEN attack paths are displayed THEN the system SHALL show technique dependencies and logical progression

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security operations manager, I want to analyze defensive coverage gaps against specific threat groups so that I can prioritize security investments and identify unmitigated risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies threat groups THEN the system SHALL analyze all techniques used by those groups
2. WHEN a user provides implemented mitigations THEN the system SHALL exclude already-covered techniques from gap analysis
3. WHEN coverage gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL calculate coverage percentages and prioritize unmitigated techniques
4. WHEN gap analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for improving defensive posture
5. WHEN multiple threat groups are analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify common techniques and high-impact gaps

### Requirement 10
