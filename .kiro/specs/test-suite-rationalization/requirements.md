# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to rationalize and optimize the existing test suite by organizing tests into logical categories, eliminating redundancy, and improving execution performance while maintaining high code coverage. The current test suite contains 32 test files with potential overlap and unclear organization, making it difficult to maintain and slow to execute.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Categorization and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests organized into clear categories so that I can run specific types of tests based on my development needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL categorize tests into unit, integration, performance, compatibility, deployment, and end-to-end test categories
2. WHEN categorizing tests THEN each test file SHALL be assigned to exactly one primary category with clear naming conventions following the pattern `tests/{category}/test_{module}.py`
3. WHEN running tests THEN developers SHALL be able to execute tests by category using pytest markers and directory structure
4. WHEN viewing test structure THEN the directory structure SHALL clearly reflect test categories with subdirectories for each type

### Requirement 2: Test Overlap and Redundancy Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant and overlapping tests so that the test suite is more maintainable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing tests THEN the system SHALL identify tests that cover identical functionality
2. WHEN consolidating tests THEN redundant test cases SHALL be merged or removed while preserving coverage
3. WHEN refactoring tests THEN overlapping test scenarios SHALL be consolidated into comprehensive test cases
4. WHEN removing tests THEN code coverage SHALL not decrease below current levels

### Requirement 3: Test Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want faster test execution so that I can get quicker feedback during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing tests THEN total test execution time SHALL be reduced by at least 30%
2. WHEN running tests THEN slow-running tests SHALL be identified and optimized or moved to appropriate categories
3. WHEN executing unit tests THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for the entire suite
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL use efficient setup and teardown mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Code Coverage Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain high code coverage so that I can ensure comprehensive testing of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rationalizing tests THEN code coverage SHALL remain at or above 90%
2. WHEN removing redundant tests THEN coverage gaps SHALL be identified and addressed
3. WHEN consolidating tests THEN all critical code paths SHALL remain tested
4. WHEN generating coverage reports THEN they SHALL clearly show coverage by test category

### Requirement 5: Test Configuration and Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible test execution options so that I can run appropriate tests for different development scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tests THEN pytest markers SHALL be used to enable category-based test execution
2. WHEN running tests THEN developers SHALL be able to exclude slow tests during rapid development cycles
3. WHEN executing CI/CD pipelines THEN different test categories SHALL run in appropriate pipeline stages
4. WHEN running tests locally THEN developers SHALL have clear commands for different test scenarios
