# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Following the successful completion of the STIX2 library refactor, the web explorer component requires both dependency resolution and significant user experience enhancements. The immediate issue is that the `aiohttp` module cannot be imported, preventing the web interface from starting. Additionally, the current web interface needs modernization to provide better data exploration capabilities, improved usability, and a more professional appearance.

The web explorer is a critical component that provides browser-based access to all 8 MCP tools through an intuitive interface, making advanced threat intelligence analysis accessible to security professionals without requiring command-line expertise. This enhancement will transform it from a basic functional interface into a comprehensive threat intelligence exploration platform.

4. WHEN data loading status is shown THEN it SHALL indicate the freshness and source of the MITRE ATT&CK data
5. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN it SHALL provide an overview of the threat intelligence dataset scope and coverage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a threat intelligence researcher, I want intelligent form controls with pre-populated options so that I can easily explore the dataset without needing to memorize specific IDs or names.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use threat group analysis tools THEN dropdown menus SHALL be populated with available APT groups from the loaded data
2. WHEN I build attack paths THEN tactic dropdowns SHALL show all available tactics with their names and IDs
3. WHEN I search for techniques THEN autocomplete suggestions SHALL be provided based on loaded technique data
4. WHEN I analyze coverage gaps THEN group selection SHALL offer searchable dropdowns with group names and aliases
5. WHEN I use any tool requiring entity selection THEN the interface SHALL provide intuitive selection mechanisms with real data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user of the web interface, I want a modern, responsive design with proper output handling so that I can efficiently review analysis results regardless of their size or complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN query results are displayed THEN the output area SHALL have responsive height with automatic scrollbars for large results
2. WHEN I resize the browser window THEN all interface elements SHALL adapt appropriately to different screen sizes
3. WHEN results contain structured data THEN they SHALL be formatted with proper syntax highlighting and indentation
4. WHEN I execute multiple queries THEN the interface SHALL maintain a clean, organized layout without visual clutter
5. WHEN I interact with form controls THEN they SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and validation

### Requirement 8
