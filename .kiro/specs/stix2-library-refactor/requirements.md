# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the current custom STIX parser implementation to use the official STIX2 Python library. The current implementation in `src/parsers/stix_parser.py` contains custom parsing logic for STIX 2.1 format data, but our steering documentation emphasizes using official, battle-tested libraries over custom implementations. The official `stix2` library provides robust, standards-compliant parsing with better error handling, validation, and future-proofing.

This refactoring aligns with our core principle: "Always prefer official libraries for well-known protocols and formats."

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the MITRE ATT&CK MCP server, I want to use the official STIX2 library so that I can leverage battle-tested, standards-compliant parsing with better error handling and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes STIX data THEN it SHALL use the official `stix2` Python library instead of custom parsing logic
2. WHEN STIX objects are parsed THEN the system SHALL leverage the library's built-in validation and error handling
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged from the user perspective
4. WHEN invalid STIX data is encountered THEN the system SHALL use the library's robust error handling mechanisms

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security analyst using the MCP server, I want the same data extraction capabilities so that all existing MCP tools continue to work exactly as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN techniques are extracted THEN the system SHALL provide the same fields (id, name, description, platforms, tactics, mitigations)
2. WHEN groups are extracted THEN the system SHALL provide the same fields (id, name, description, aliases, techniques)
3. WHEN tactics are extracted THEN the system SHALL provide the same fields (id, name, description)
4. WHEN mitigations are extracted THEN the system SHALL provide the same fields (id, name, description, techniques)
5. WHEN relationship analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same relationship mapping capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want improved error handling and validation so that the system is more robust when processing malformed or invalid STIX data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN malformed STIX data is encountered THEN the system SHALL use the official library's validation to provide detailed error messages
2. WHEN STIX schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle errors and continue processing valid objects
3. WHEN unknown STIX object types are encountered THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings without crashing
4. WHEN STIX version compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL leverage the library's version handling capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer extending the system, I want to leverage the official STIX2 library's advanced features so that I can easily add support for additional STIX object types and relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new STIX object types need to be supported THEN the system SHALL use the library's extensible object model
2. WHEN complex STIX relationships need to be processed THEN the system SHALL leverage the library's relationship handling
3. WHEN STIX data needs to be validated THEN the system SHALL use the library's built-in validation mechanisms
4. WHEN STIX objects need to be created or modified THEN the system SHALL use the library's object creation APIs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage for the refactored implementation so that I can ensure the migration maintains all existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass without modification
2. WHEN new STIX2 library functionality is added THEN comprehensive unit tests SHALL be created
3. WHEN error handling is tested THEN tests SHALL cover both library-specific and application-specific error scenarios
4. WHEN performance is evaluated THEN the new implementation SHALL maintain or improve parsing performance
5. WHEN integration tests are run THEN they SHALL verify that all 8 MCP tools continue to work with real MITRE ATT&CK data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want the system to support future STIX standard updates so that the MCP server remains compatible with evolving threat intelligence formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new STIX versions are released THEN the system SHALL benefit from the official library's update support
2. WHEN STIX specification changes occur THEN the system SHALL leverage the library's standards compliance
3. WHEN new STIX object properties are added THEN the system SHALL automatically support them through the library
4. WHEN STIX validation rules change THEN the system SHALL use the updated library validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer following the project's architecture principles, I want the refactoring to align with our "library-first development" approach so that the codebase follows established best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom parsing logic is removed THEN it SHALL be replaced with official library calls
2. WHEN STIX type mappings are needed THEN they SHALL use the library's built-in type system
3. WHEN STIX object validation is required THEN it SHALL use the library's validation framework
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the code SHALL demonstrate proper use of official libraries over custom implementations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the refactoring to maintain backward compatibility so that existing deployments continue to work without configuration changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored system is deployed THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN MCP tools are called THEN they SHALL return the same response formats as before
3. WHEN configuration files are processed THEN they SHALL work with the new implementation without changes
4. WHEN the web interface is used THEN it SHALL function identically to the previous implementation
5. WHEN performance is measured THEN the new implementation SHALL not significantly degrade response times
