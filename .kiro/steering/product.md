- Access relationships between security entities
- Provide structured cybersecurity threat intelligence data

### Advanced Threat Modeling Capabilities
- **Attack Path Construction**: Build multi-stage attack paths through the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain
- **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Analyze defensive coverage gaps against specific threat groups
- **Complex Relationship Discovery**: Explore STIX relationships, attribution chains, and technique hierarchies
- **Threat Group Profiling**: Deep analysis of threat actor techniques and patterns
- **Platform-Specific Analysis**: Filter and analyze techniques by target platforms

### Web-Based Interface

## Extensibility Design

This MCP server is designed to be **extensible and reusable**:

### Framework Agnostic Architecture
- **Multi-Framework Support**: While initially built for MITRE ATT&CK, the architecture supports any structured security framework
- **Configuration-Driven**: Data sources, entity types, and tool definitions are externalized to configuration files
- **Pluggable Data Sources**: Support for different threat intelligence formats and sources through configuration
- **Standards-Compliant**: Uses official MCP protocol and STIX parsing libraries

### Modular Tool System
- **8 Comprehensive Tools**: 5 basic analysis tools + 3 advanced threat modeling tools
- **Easy Tool Addition**: New MCP tools can be easily added without modifying core server logic
- **Consistent Interfaces**: All tools follow the same parameter and response patterns
- **Flexible Deployment**: Tools accessible via both MCP protocol and HTTP/JSON API

### Multiple Access Methods
- **MCP Protocol**: Direct integration with Large Language Models and AI assistants
- **HTTP/JSON API**: RESTful access for web applications and custom integrations
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based access for interactive analysis and exploration
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment-based configuration for different deployment scenarios
